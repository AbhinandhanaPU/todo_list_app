# **To-Do List App with Firebase Authentication and State Management using Provider**

## ðŸ“œ **Overview**
 This is a Flutter-based To-Do List app that leverages **Firebase Authentication** for secure user login and **Firebase Realtime Database** to store tasks. The app uses **Provider** for efficient state management and follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture for maintainability and separation of concerns.

## ðŸ›  **Featues**

1. **User Authentication**
    - Secure login and signup using Firebase Authentication (Email/Password).

    - **Delete tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.

3.  **State Management**
    - Uses **Provider** for managing both authentication state and task state.

4.  **Database Integration**
    - Tasks are stored and fetched from **Firebase Realtime Database** using **REST API** calls.

5.  **Responsiveness**
    - The app adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, providing an optimal user experience.

## **Tech Stack**
- Frontend : The app is built using **Flutter** for a cross-platform mobile experience  
- Backend Implementation: **Firebase** is used for Authentication and Real-time database

### ðŸ–¥ **Architecture**
- **MVVM Architecture**
    - **Model**: Represents the data (tasks and user).
